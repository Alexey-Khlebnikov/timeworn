### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**timeworn/timeworn** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on http://tarax.io
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mastering on React, Angular, Go and Nest Js
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on large scale application
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with open source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the React and Angular
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started coding when i was 9 years old.
